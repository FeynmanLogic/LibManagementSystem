# Library Management System
This is a library management system built in C++. It utilizes Object Oriented Programming, and utilizes multiple aspects such as Inheritance, Encapsulation and Data Abstraction.

# Problem Statement:


Design and implement a Library Management System in C++ that allows librarians to efficiently manage the day-to-day operations of a library without using file handling. The system should provide functionalities to add new books, remove existing books, update book information, and manage library members. It should also include features to handle book borrowing and returning, track overdue books, and generate reports.

## Key Features:

### Book Management:
Implement a data structure (e.g., arrays, linked lists) to store information about books, including details such as title, author, ISBN, genre, and quantity.
Add new books to the library.
Remove books that are no longer part of the library collection.
Update information for existing books.
### Member Management:
Implement a data structure to store information about library members.
Add new members to the library.
Remove members who are no longer associated with the library.
Update member information.
### Borrowing and Returning:
Design a system to handle book borrowing and returning using appropriate data structures.
Set a maximum borrowing limit for each member.
Track due dates for borrowed books and handle returns.
Calculate and display fines for overdue books.
### Search and Display:
Implement search functionalities using the available data structures to find books by title, author, or ISBN.
Display available books and their details.
Show a list of borrowed books by a specific member.
